                <p>The Inventory Summary for this month provides an overview of the essential supplies and medical
                    equipment available in the aged care facility.
                    As of the latest report, the facility has a stock of 500 units of daily necessities, including
                    toiletries and personal hygiene products, with 85% of these items currently in use.
                    Medical supplies, such as gloves, masks, and antiseptics, are at 70% capacity with 150 units
                    remaining in stock. Additionally, medication inventory stands at 60%, with approximately 120 doses
                    of general prescription drugs available.
                    Based on current usage rates, we anticipate restocking essential supplies and medications within the
                    next two weeks to ensure continuous availability for residents and staff.</p>

                <p>The Facility Management Summary for this month highlights the effective utilisation and maintenance
                    of the facilityâ€™s resources.
                    All 50 patient rooms are currently occupied, ensuring that residents receive the personalised care
                    they need. The three recreational rooms,

                    activities, with participation rates averaging 80% throughout the month. Staff rooms,
                    including break rooms and office spaces, are operating at 90% capacity, providing essential support
                    for the care team. The five medical rooms, such as the Therapy Room and Medical Examination Room,
                    have been operating at full capacity, handling an average of 200 medical appointments and therapy
                    sessions. Regular maintenance has been conducted in all areas, ensuring a safe and comfortable
                    environment
                    for both residents and staff. Plans are in place to expand recreational facilities to meet the
                    growing demand for resident activities and social engagement</p>
